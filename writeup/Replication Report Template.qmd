## Introduction

### Justification
I chose Caballero et al. (2023) Study 2 because it experimentally manipulates perceived economic scarcity to test how it shifts people’s construal level, or their tendency to think in concrete versus abstract terms. This focus on cognitive style and self-control under scarcity directly connects to my interests in the psychology of poverty, dignity, and institutional precarity. I am interested in how experiences of resource insecurity shape short-term versus long-term decision-making, and how interventions might target these different mindsets to help break individuals out of poverty cycles.

Caballero et al. (2023) build on Construal Level Theory (Trope & Liberman, 2003), which proposes that psychological distance influences whether people think concretely or abstractly. In their Study 2, participants were randomly assigned to a “scarcity” or “non-scarcity” condition within a fictional society called Bimboola, and the researchers measured how this manipulation changed participants’ thinking styles using the Behavioral Identification Form (BIF). They found that those in the scarcity condition thought more concretely about actions and goals, confirming that perceived financial limitation causally narrows one’s cognitive focus to the immediate present.

### Stimuli & Procedures
This replication will follow Caballero et al. (2023) Study 2. The original sample included 120 undergraduate participants (102 women) who were randomly assigned to a scarcity or non-scarcity condition. All data were collected individually in lab cubicles via Qualtrics.

The procedure consisted of:
1. **BIF (Pre-test):** 12 items from the Behavioral Identification Form, where each action (e.g., “locking a door”) is described at two levels: 1. a concrete “how” description (“putting the key in the lock”) and 2. an abstract “why” description (“securing the house”). Participants select which feels more natural.  
2. **Economic-scarcity manipulation (fictional society):** Participants imagined living in a fictional society (Bimboola) organized by five income groups.  
   - **Scarcity condition:** assigned to the lowest income tier (≤ 400 Bimboolean per month) and required to choose items such as housing, transportation, and leisure from unattractive, low-resource options while viewing the better alternatives available to wealthier groups.  
   - **Non-scarcity condition:** assigned to a comfortable middle-income tier (1,201–3,000 Bimboolean) and made similar choices among adequate options.  
3. **BIF (Post-test):** A second 12-item subset of the BIF  (non-overlapping with the pre-test) measured change in abstraction.  
4. **Manipulation checks:** “My group is poor” and “My group is rich” on 7-point scales, plus an estimated group-income question.  
5. **Demographics & debrief.**

**Challenges:**  
One challenge in replicating this study include adapting the materials to an English-speaking Prolific population rather than the original Spanish-speaking undergraduate sample. Another challenge involves maintaining participant attention across both the pre- and post-manipulation Behavioral Identification Form (BIF) scales, which may induce some fatigue, especially in the second half. Finally, ensuring that the scarcity manipulation feels psychologically “real” in an online environment—without the presence of an experimenter—will be important for preserving the strength of the original effect that was does individually in cubicles.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.




### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
